                <ul>
                    <li>“Green day” was California slang for a day spent smoking marijuana. The band chose it jokingly, reflecting their teenage rebellion and laid-back attitude.</li>
                    <li>Released in 1989 when they were still called <span class="bold">Sweet Children.</span> They changed the name to Green Day to avoid confusion with another local band.</li>
                    <li>In 2010, the album was adapted into a stage musical featuring choreography, actors, and a punk rock vibe. It received critical acclaim and Tony nominations.</li>
